An online commerce platform to facilitate online ordering.

This application will collect data in two ways:

* Through web forms allowing users to enter trip/station information
* By consuming CSV files with historical information for stations and trips. In addition to creating and storing this information for viewing at a later date, this application will provide a number of user dashboards with higher level analysis of trends in bike share usage.
